# ✅ Day 4 - Lists, Tuples & To-Do CLI App

Welcome to Day 4 of the 17-Day Python Challenge!  
This day focused on understanding two of Python's core data structures: **Lists** and **Tuples**, along with building a basic **To-Do List CLI Application**.

---

## 📘 Concepts Covered

### 📌 Lists
- Creation and Indexing
- Slicing & Updating
- `.append()`, `.remove()`, `.pop()`, `.insert()`
- `.sort()`, `.reverse()`, `.copy()`
- List Comprehensions
- Looping through lists

### 📌 Tuples
- Immutable sequences
- Accessing tuple elements
- Tuple unpacking
- `len()`, `.count()`, `.index()` methods

## 🛠️ Mini Project: To-Do List (CLI)

A command-line app where the user can:
- Add tasks
- View all tasks
- Remove tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- Exit when finished

✅ Uses **lists** to manage tasks dynamically  
✅ Simple menu system with input-based options  
✅ Reinforces list methods and user interaction logic
